# LatentSemanticIndexing_IRProject
Final project of the Information Retreival Course of the master degree in Data Science and Scientific computing.

## Project Requirements
- Write an IR system that uses latent semantic indexing to answer queries.
- The system must accept free-form text queries.
- Evaluate the system on a set of queries…
- …and try to use different dimensions for the dimensionality reduction.

## Data
For this project we used two datasets: [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) and [NPL collection](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/npl/)
The second dataset is already in this repository, while the other must be downloaded from the link above (extract everythning inside the dicrectory data/)

## System Requirements
- At least 16 Gb of RAM
